## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Choices Explained

This project was built with a focus on creating a scalable, maintainable, and efficient application by leveraging a modern tech stack and following best practices in Flutter development.

### **Core Framework**

  * **Flutter:** Chosen for its cross-platform capabilities, allowing for a single codebase for both Android and iOS, and its rich set of pre-built widgets for building a beautiful and responsive UI.

### **Architecture & State Management**

  * **BLoC (Business Logic Component):** The app uses the `flutter_bloc` package for state management. This pattern was chosen to separate the business logic from the UI, which makes the code more organized, easier to test, and scalable. The `TasksCubit` manages the state of the tasks, handling loading, success, and error states seamlessly.

### **Networking**

  * **Dio & Retrofit:** For handling API requests, `dio` was chosen for its robustness and rich feature set, including interceptors. `retrofit` is used for generating type-safe network code, which simplifies the process of making API calls and parsing responses.
  * **`pretty_dio_logger`:** This interceptor was used during development to log network requests and responses, which is incredibly helpful for debugging.

### **Dependency Injection**

  * **GetIt:** The `get_it` package is used as a service locator for dependency injection. This helps in decoupling the app's components and makes it easier to manage dependencies and mock them for testing.

### **Data Serialization**

  * **`json_serializable` & `freezed`:** These packages are used to automate the process of converting JSON data from the API into Dart objects. `freezed` is particularly useful for creating immutable data models and sealed classes, which helps prevent bugs.

### **UI & UX**

  * **`flutter_screenutil`:** This package is used to make the UI responsive across different screen sizes and densities, ensuring a consistent user experience.
  * **`cached_network_image`:** Used for loading and caching network images to improve performance and reduce network usage.
  * **`google_fonts`:** Provides easy access to a wide variety of fonts to enhance the app's typography.

### **Secure Storage**

  * **`flutter_secure_storage`:** Used to securely store the API key, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed.
